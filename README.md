Recent developments in computer vision point to promising trends in Vision Transformers.
Models such as ViT and DeIT have shown competitive advantage over residual convolutional networks. In this paper,
we test vulnerabilities of these models to specially designed attacks -- token attacks matching the token size of the vision transformer architecture.
We find that vision transformers are more susceptible to such attacks as compared to ResNets. However when token attacks of different sizes are considered, the robust
accuracies are not as significantly affected. This highlights a new direction for designing adversarial attacks inspired by network architecture.
